         <div class="title abt">ABOUT THIS WEBPAGE AND ITS CREATOR! ₊˚｡★ ｡</div>
         <div class="subheada">Hello! It's me, Sarah the creator of this webpage. Want to learn more about me? You've come to the right place! Let me start with a short introduction:</div>
         <div class="self"></div>
         <div class="intro">I was introduced to the concept of alternative music a while ago when 100gecs first surfaced more on social media. I was interested in their style of music almost instantly, as it had a different take than mainstream music and . For awhile, I did not have exposure to any other hyperpop artist, until a friend of mine directed me to some more artists they personally listened to. After this, I was able to discover more artists on my own and have now become very familiar with most commononly know artists. My personal favourites, for anyone who is curious, are osquinn, 8485, Alice Gas, Siouxxie, WHOKILLEDXIX and Stxlkin. As well, my all time favourite hyperpop song is <i>Special, by Alice Gas and 8485</i> <br> <br> <br> My aim by creating this webpage to spread more information about Hyperpop as a music genre and have more people have access to information on the topic. And hey, you, the person reading this could be interested in checking it out for yourself. Another reason I chose this topic is that I am well acquainted with it. When I first started to get into this music genre, I had absolutely no idea what it was, since there aren’t many online resources that talk about getting into it as well as different artists as recommendations. I plan on helping others who want to expand their musical range and give hyperpop a try by offering the adequate resources I didn’t have when I first started off. <br><br><br> <b>FUN FACT:</b> I listened to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2tkC17bLEd9fbX2VsBIZ4x">my own hyperpop playlist</a> while creating this webpage. Helped the creativity and inspiration flow, yk? <br><br> I also drew the small self portrait of myself to the left! Credit to <u>@s0zalsan</u> for the base.</div>
