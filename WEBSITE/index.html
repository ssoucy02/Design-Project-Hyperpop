            <div class="cover masq"></div>
            <div class="dev">Before being known as hyperpop, the common name you‚Äôd hear <br>  nowadays, hyperpop is thought to have made its debut during the rise <br> of scene in for 2000‚Äôs <i class="dull"> (for more information on scene culture and its <br> impact, you can check out a couple sources linked below) </i> when alternative music had a rise in popularity. Hyperpop can also be linked to Nightcore, a style of music which took pre-existing songs and sped and pitched them up to give them a faster, more upbeat tone to the song. Hyperpop is music <i class="dull"> ‚Äúcharacterized by a maximalist or exaggerated take on popular music‚Äù - Wikipedia. </i> My personal take is; music that is fast, flashy, hyperactive and loud <i class="dull">(in the best way, of course).</i> Music of this genre usually uses heavy autotune to exaggerate a point, loud electronic instruments as opposed to acoustic. The use of these are often uncoordinated or chaotic, as well as distorted. This is what helps hyperpop in being such a distinct and notable music form, as it breaks the mold of most mainstream music. In my notation, you either enjoy this style or you have a strong distaste for it. Many people may find it too loud, confusing or, due to its uncoordinated nature, messy. However, all of this is simply my take. Do note that this genre is very loosely defined and it is difficult to classify what exactly it entails. You can typically recognize hyperpop songs visually just by their bright and flashy cover albums, sometimes paired with trippy fonts. Although hyperpop can be typically thought of to be bright and cheery, you‚Äôll often find darker messages hidden within the lyrics of a song if you listen closely <i class="dull"> (or do some lyric analysis).</i> It can be difficult to understand them at times though due to distortion or volume, so I don‚Äôt blame you if you <center> struggle to sing along. </center> <br><br> <center>The Impact and more on Scene culture: <a href="https://www.popmatters.com/scene-subculture-origins-hardcore-harajuku">‚òÜ</a> <a href="https://lseclarion.com/12165/arts-and-entertainment/the-rawr-ing-twenties-emo-and-scene-culture-has-risen-from-the-dead-perhaps-making-a-comeback-in-the-2020s/"> üú≤</a> </center> </div>
