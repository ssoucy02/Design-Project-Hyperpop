            </center>
            <div class="subheada bc">Hello! You’ve visited this page because you’re interested in getting into the hyperpop music scene. Luckily for you, I have some suggestions for getting started. Whether it's making your own music, or simply listening to it, I’m here to help. NOTE! This is my personal guide and advice, feel free to take this information and do whatever you'd like with it.</div>
            <div class="point">- Search for premade playlists</div>
            <div class="intro sb">Premade playlists can be found all over youtube and spotify, which are the platforms I personally use a lot. I’ll link a few personal suggestions below along with my own hyperpop playlist for those who are curious.
            </div>
            <div class="point">- Do a bit of research</div>
            <div class="intro sb">If you’re looking for some good artists, do some research to see which artists are most liked and mainstream. I also encourage you to look for more obscure artists as they can produce great work and it can go underrated. (For a longer list of artist suggestions, you can check out the <a href="/WEBSITE/artists.html"> artist </a> tab which will include a long list of hyperpop artists, recent or older. 
            </div>
            <div class="point">- Look for collabs between artists</div>
            <div class="intro sb">Hyperpop artists frequently collaborate with other artists to make songs, so this is a good way to expand your knowledge base of artists. Just look through albums or singles released by an artist you like and see who else some of the songs feature! You'll find this is a very effective method, and often you'll enjoy their music just as much. </div>
            <center><div class="point continue">Onto making your own...</div></center>
            <div class="point">- Search for inspiration from your favorite artists</div>
            <div class="intro sb">If you enjoy their music, chances are you’d like to live up to their music! I’m not telling you to steal ideas, but take inspiration from your favorite tracks! Credit never hurts either (for when you take inspiration). Just look their past songs, albums and singles, as well as any discographies, podcasts or post they've made regarding msic and their journey. You can also do a little deeper diving into their inspiration and why they make music themselves. You can get to know the artist on a more personal level while grasping your own inspiration from them.
            </div>
            <div class="point">- Check what kinds of equipment popular artists use</div>
            <div class="intro sb">Check in on some hyperpop artists and find out what type of microphones, mixers, soundboards and programs they use to make their music! If not, you can always ask them (some artists have specific moments where they will take QnA, such as on timed instagram stories or have a FAQ page) with manners, of course! You could also ask them for some recommendations on your music making journey too, while you’re at it!
            </div>
            <div class="point">- Look out for sound libraries</div>
            <div class="intro sb">Hyperpop will typically include special touches, which can include some unique sounds. You’ll find lots to work with in copyright free sound libraries.
            </div>
            <div class="point">- Work on your art/editing skills!</div>
            <div class="intro sb">Cover art is important for any music, and hyperpop art covers typically include bright colors and anime characters (although the cover art style can vary greatly between artists!) Touch up on your skills to make top quality art covers! Alternatively, you can always find people who will be willing to help on various sites.
